# Advanced ML First Assignment: Model Building

## Overview

This assignment consists of two main tasks focused on building machine learning models using specified datasets. The objective is to practice data cleaning, feature engineering, and achieving reasonable model accuracy while adhering to specific restrictions on model complexity.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Adult Income Dataset
- **Dataset**: [Adult Income Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult)
- **Objective**: Build a model with reasonable accuracy.
- **Requirements**:
  - Perform necessary data cleaning.
  - Conduct feature engineering to improve model performance.
  
### Task 2: Spaceship Titanic Dataset
- **Dataset**: [Spaceship Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/hadifarahani/Advanced-ML-SBU/tree/main/Data)
- **Objective**: Achieve a model accuracy of above 79%.
- **Requirements**:
  - Focus on adding additive features.
  - Consider the Cabin feature from the dataset.
  - Implement variable discretization.

## Restrictions
1. **Model Complexity**: 
   - Students are not permitted to use complex models, including ANN-based models or any gradient boosting methods for both tasks.
2. **Result Integrity**: 
   - Manually altering final results is prohibited. All results must be 100% reproducible.
   - The emphasis is on practicing feature engineering to enhance model accuracy without increasing model complexity.
     
## Conclusion
This assignment provides a hands-on opportunity to apply data science skills in model building while adhering to strict guidelines aimed at reinforcing the importance of feature engineering and model simplicity.
